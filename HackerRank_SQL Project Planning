You are given a table, Projects, containing three columns: Task_ID, Start_Date and End_Date. 
It is guaranteed that the difference between the End_Date and the Start_Date is equal to 1 day for each row in the table.

If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project. 
Samantha is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.

Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days it took to complete the project in ascending order. 
If there is more than one project that have the same number of completion days, 
then order by the start date of the project.

테이블에서 각 프로젝트의 시작일과 종료일을 구하는 문제를 해결합니다. 
프로젝트는 연속적인 날짜로 이어지는 작업들을 그룹화하여, 각각의 프로젝트가 언제 시작되었고 언제 끝났는지 계산합니다. 
쿼리는 각 프로젝트의 시작일과 종료일, 그리고 해당 프로젝트가 걸린 일수를 계산하고, 이를 오름차순으로 정렬합니다
