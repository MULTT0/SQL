[Basic Join]
Q.
You are given two tables: Students and Grades. Students contains three columns ID, Name and Marks.

<Students>
Column | Type
ID | Integer
Name | String
Marks | Integer

<Grades>
Grade | Min_Mark | Max_Mark
1 | 0 | 9
2 | 10 | 19
2 | 20 | 29
3 | 20 | 29
4 | 30 | 39
5 | 40 | 59

Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. 
Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. 
The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, 
order those particular students by their name alphabetically. 
Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, 
order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.

Write a query to help Eve.

<Sample Input>
ID | Name | Marks
1 | Julia | 88
2 | Samantha | 68
3 | Maria | 99
4 | Scarlet | 78
5 | Ashely | 63
6 | Jane | 81

<Sample Output>
Maria 10 99
Jane 9 81
Julia 9 88 
Scarlet 8 78
NULL 7 63
NULL 7 68

<Note>
Print "NULL"  as the name if the grade is less than 8.

<Explanation>
Consider the following table with the grades assigned to the students:
ID | Name | Marks | Grade
1 | Julia | 88 | 9
2 | Samantha | 68 | 7
3 | Maria | 99 | 10
4 | Scarlet | 78 | 8
5 | Ashley | 63 | 7
6 | Jane | 81 | 9

So, the following students got 8, 9 or 10 grades:
Maria (grade 10)
Jane (grade 9)
Julia (grade 9)
Scarlet (grade 8)

ANWSER.
```
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN B.Grade >= 8
        THEN A.Name
    ELSE NULL END AS Name
    , B.Grade
    , A.Marks
FROM Students A
LEFT JOIN Grades B
ON A.Marks BETWEEN B.Min_Mark AND B.Max_Mark
ORDER BY Grade Desc,
    CASE WHEN Grade >= 8 THEN Name END,
    CASE WHEN Grade < 8 THEN Marks END;
```

답에서 Grades에 없는 Grade가 Students에 있을 수 있으므로 JOIN이 더 정확할 수도 있고
LEFT JOIN을 사용한다면 WHERE B.Grade IS NOT NULL 추가해서 정확성을 높이면 좋을 것 같다.
